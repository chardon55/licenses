# MIT License

## Description

This brief license is popular in the Open Source world. It was originally written and used by the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://web.mit.edu/) for permitting the usage of its open-source programs.

As a permissive license, it restricts very little on reusing, redistribution etc. However, due to this, it is compatible with most other licenses.
