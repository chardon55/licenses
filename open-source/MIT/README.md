# Expat License (MIT License)

## Description

The MIT License, which also called "Expat License" as the recommendation of Free Software Foundation, is a lax and permissive license.

This brief license is popular in the Open Source world. It was originally written and used by the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://web.mit.edu/) for its many open-source programs.

As a permissive license, it restricts very little on reusing, redistribution etc. However, due to this, it is compatible with most other licenses.
